## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how raw **trade and customs data** can be transformed into **actionable insights** for decision-makers.  

The workflow covers:
- Cleaning raw, inconsistent data  
- Exploring patterns and relationships through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Engineering business-relevant features such as compliance, taxation fairness, and timeliness  
- Building an **interactive dashboard** to monitor trade activities, taxation efficiency, and compliance  

The end result is a comprehensive data product that provides customs authorities, policymakers, and analysts with a clear view of trade flows, risks, and opportunities.
